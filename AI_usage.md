# AI Usage in Merchant Social Intelligence Agents Development

# Claude 4 Sonnet

## Overview
This document describes how AI tools were strategically used throughout the development of the Merchant Social Intelligence Agents system, from initial data analysis to final implementation and testing.

## üîç Data Analysis Phase

### Claude 4 Sonnet for EDA Code Generation
**Tool Used:** Claude 4 Sonnet via Anthropic Console  
**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive Python code for exploratory data analysis of merchant messages

**How I Used It:**
- **Code Generation:** Asked Claude to create a complete `MerchantDataAnalyzer` class with methods for statistical analysis
- **Analysis Framework:** Had Claude design methods for geographic clustering, pattern recognition, and quality detection
- **Data Processing Logic:** Generated code to identify business opportunities and matching rules from raw data
- **Output Formatting:** Created formatted console output and JSON serialization for results

**AI-Generated Code Components:**
```python
class MerchantDataAnalyzer:
    def basic_statistics(self)           # Geographic distribution analysis
    def identify_geographic_clusters(self) # Hotspot detection logic
    def analyze_message_patterns(self)    # Keyword pattern matching
    def identify_business_opportunities(self) # Cluster discovery
    def detect_quality_issues(self)      # Low-quality message detection
    def generate_matching_rules(self)    # Rule generation for agents
```

**What I Did vs What AI Did:**
- **I Executed:** Ran the AI-generated code on real dataset in Jupyter notebook
- **I Analyzed:** Interpreted the quantitative results to extract business insights
- **AI Generated:** The analytical framework and data processing logic
- **AI Created:** Robust code with error handling and JSON serialization

**Key Outputs from Running AI-Generated Code:**
```
üìä Geographic Hotspots: Santos (34 messages, 7 merchants) & Sorocaba (30 messages, 6 merchants)
üéØ Business Clusters: Santos Logistics (5 merchants identified)
‚ö†Ô∏è Quality Issues: 32 problematic messages with specific patterns
üí° Service Matching: 1 marketing provider matched to 3 needers
```

**Why This Approach:** Rather than asking AI to analyze the data directly, I used AI to create sophisticated analytical tools that I could run on the real data, ensuring reproducible and verifiable results.

- **Integration Patterns:** Explored how to integrate real data insights into agent decision-making

**AI-Assisted Design Decisions:**
- **RouterAgent First:** AI suggested classification before moderation for efficiency
- **Conditional Routing:** AI recommended skipping matchmaker for off-topic/low-quality messages
- **Shared Context:** AI proposed enriching state with geographic and cluster information
- **Error Handling:** AI emphasized graceful degradation for JSON parsing failures

## üíª Code Implementation Phase

### Claude for Code Generation and Problem Solving
**Tool Used:** Claude 4 Sonnet  
**Purpose:** Generate high-quality, production-ready code with proper error handling

**How I Used It:**
- **Agent Classes:** Generated initial implementations for each agent with proper typing
- **LangGraph Integration:** Created workflow orchestration code with conditional edges
- **Data Processing:** Implemented MerchantDataProcessor with robust CSV handling

**Code Quality Improvements by AI:**
```python
# AI suggested TypedDict for better type safety
class AgentState(TypedDict, total=False):
    message: str
    user_id: str
    intent: Optional[str]
    # ... all fields properly typed

# AI recommended graceful JSON parsing
try:
    parsed = json.loads(resp.content)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    # Fallback logic suggested by AI
    intent = "general_inquiry"
    confidence = 0.3
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy Development

### Claude for Comprehensive Test Suite Design
**Tool Used:** Claude 4 Sonnet 
**Purpose:** Create thorough testing strategy covering unit, integration, and E2E tests

**How I Used It:**
- **Test Architecture:** Designed fixture-based testing with proper mocking strategies
- **Mock Strategies:** Created sophisticated LLM mocking that returns valid JSON responses
- **Test Scenarios:** Generated realistic test cases based on EDA findings
- **Edge Cases:** Identified and tested error conditions and boundary cases

**AI-Generated Testing Innovations:**
- **Sequential Mock Responses:** For testing complete workflows with different agent responses
- **Real Scenario Tests:** Test cases based on actual merchant messages from EDA
- **Fixture Reusability:** Modular fixtures that can be composed for different test needs
- **Performance Testing:** Strategies for testing response times and concurrent requests

## üîß Problem Solving and Debugging

### Claude for Issue Resolution
**Tool Used:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet  
**Purpose:** Solve implementation challenges and fix complex bugs

**Critical Problems Solved with AI:**
1. **LangGraph State Management:** AI helped debug state flow between agents
2. **JSON Parsing Reliability:** AI suggested robust error handling for LLM responses
3. **Mock Testing Issues:** AI identified and fixed mock configuration problems
4. **FastAPI Integration:** AI resolved serialization issues with complex response schemas

**Example AI-Assisted Bug Fix:**
```python
# Problem: Mock LLM wasn't returning proper response format
# AI Solution: Create proper mock response object structure
mock_response = Mock()
mock_response.content = '{"intent": "logistics_sharing", "confidence": 0.8}'
mock_llm.invoke.return_value = mock_response
```

## üìù Documentation and Communication

### Claude for Technical Documentation
**Tool Used:** Claude 4 Sonnet

## CHAT GPT-4o-mini-high

During this project, I leveraged ChatGPT (GPT-4o-Mini) to:

1. **Kickstart Architecture**  
   - Brainstorm agent responsibilities, flow diagrams, and domain-specific examples (e.g. logistics clusters, marketing providers).
   - Iterate on ‚ÄúRouter vs. Matchmaker vs. Moderator‚Äù boundaries.

2. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - Designed few-shot prompts for the ResponseGenerator to produce warm, context-aware replies.
   - Created system + user messages in the code to guide LLM toward JSON outputs.

3. **Data-Driven Decisions**  
   - Used EDA outputs (hotspots, confirmed clusters) as prompt context to bias LLM suggestions toward high-value connections.

4. **Testing Guidance**  
   - Generated pytest fixtures and unit-test outlines.
   - Defined end-to-end scenarios based on user story examples.

5. **Documentation and Readme**  
   - Drafted README with diagram, rationale, and instructions.
   - Ensured clarity on how agents integrate LLM calls vs. static rules.

_No proprietary snippets or sensitive info were shared; all LLM prompts and examples are publicly safe._
